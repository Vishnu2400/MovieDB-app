DESCRIPTION::
This is a Movie Database application built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. It allows users to view, add, edit, and delete movies from the database. The application follows RESTful routing principles and uses MVC architecture. Users can navigate through different views to perform various actions such as adding a new movie, editing existing movies, and viewing details of each movie.
